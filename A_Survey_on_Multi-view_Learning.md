A survey on Multi-view Learning

View from (1) multiple sources (2) different feature subsets;
Multi-view learning algorithms: (1) co-train (2) multi-kernel learning (3) subspace learning;
Principles: (1) consensus principle (2) complementary principle;

Multi-view forms: (1) color descriptor (2) local binary patterns (3) local shape descriper (4) words in documents
Multi-view learning: introduces one function to model a particular view and jointly optimizes all the functions to exploit the redundant views of the same input data and improve the learning performance.

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm for extracting slowly varying features from a quickly varying input signal.
